# Music-encoder-decoder

The main objective of the music encoder/decoder is to encrypt/decrypt messages using music sheets as our medium.

In simpler terms we will be turning words/sentences into playable music sheets and vice versa. After the sentence has been encrypted the music will then be played off the music sheet using piano keys.

The application attempts at deriving an meaning/emotion/feeling from the user input, and creates music that portrays the same meaning/emotion/feeling. This is currently done by using checking the user input against wordlists which determines the octave, and scale(major or minor) of the music.
